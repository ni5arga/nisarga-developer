My name is [Nisarga](https://nisarga.me) and I am a student, hacker & full stack web developer from India.

I enjoy building bots, apps, silly webpages and experimenting with new things. I'm a huge Linux & FOSS fan. I'm keenly interested in Cybersecurity. I mostly code in Javascript, Python & Go. If you want to know more about my tech stack, you can read about it [here](https://nisarga.me/about). I love to play and solve CTF challenges as well as to take part in Cryptic Hunts. 

I absolutely love researching and knowing new things - as well as hacking on weird stuff and random ideas I get. I'm good at seamlessly collaborating with teams and people to build awesome things, manage projects and productive teams. Ask me anything, I'm always glad to help you out! Always up for a coffee chat, collaboration, open-source and much more. Catch me at my twitter, socials or drop me an email and don't hesitate to reach out to me directly.
